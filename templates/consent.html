                      <p>SINGLE SESSION CONSENT FORM (AMT - PAID)</p>

                      <p>The following information is provided to inform you about the research project and your participation in it. Please read this form carefully and feel free to ask any questions you may have about this study and the information given below. You will be given an opportunity to ask questions, and your questions will be answered. Also, you will be given a copy of this consent form.</p>

                      <p>Your participation in this research study is voluntary. You are also free to withdraw from this study at any time. In the event new information becomes available that may affect the risks or benefits associated with this research study or your willingness to participate in it, you will be notified so that you can make an informed decision whether or not to continue your participation in this study.</p>

                      <ol>
                      <li><b>Purpose of the study:</b>
                      <p>The purpose of the study is to understand how people perceive, identify, and recognize birds, other animals, and objects. The specific goals will be explained in the instructions accompanying the web-based experiment.</p>

                      </li>

                      <li><b>Procedure to be followed and approximate duration of the study:</b>
                      <p>Participation in this experiment will involve identifying, remembering, or recognizing birds, other animals, or objects presented on a computer monitor. Before you begin your first experiment with us, we will ask for some demographic information and for some information about your experience identifying birds and other animals and objects.</p>

                      <p>The exact procedures will be described online before you start the experiment. But to give you a sense of the kind of tasks you might be asked to participate in, here are a few examples: You might be asked to quickly judge whether a picture of a bird depicted a House Sparrow or a Chipping Sparrow or whether a picture of a dog depicted a Dalmatian or a Rottweiler. You might be asked to view a picture of a bird (or a dog or face) flashed briefly and then be asked to say whether a new picture was the same or different. You might be asked to study some birds (or dogs or faces) and then remember which ones you saw later on. You might be asked to identify birds (or dogs or faces) at various orientations, that are flashed briefly, or that are camouflaged.</p>
                      <p>After you finish the study we will provide you with more information about the study and you can contact us by email if you have any questions about the study.</p>
                      <p>The length of this particular experiment was noted on the HIT directory. You will be compensated for each HIT you complete based on the amount listed in the HIT directory.</p>
                      <p>The data you provide will be stored and presented by subject number, not by name, so as not identify any particular participant. The study data will be stored for at least five years. The only identifying information kept with your data will be your Amazon Mechanical Turk WorkerID number.</p>
                      <p>In order to participate, you must have normal or corrected-to-normal hearing and vision, as well as no known color blindness. </p>
                      </li>

                      <li><b>Expected costs:</b>
                      <p>There are no costs to you for your participation.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li><b>Description of the discomforts, inconveniences, and/or risks that can be reasonably expected as a result of participation in this study:</b>
                      <p>We do not anticipate any risks or discomforts to you. You may find the time necessary to participate as an inconvenience. You may rest at intervals between and within tasks.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li><b>Anticipated benefits from this study:</b>
                      <p>a) The potential benefits to science and humankind that may result from this study are to understand basic mechanisms of perception, cognition, and memory and how they vary with expertise.</p>
                      <p>b) The potential benefits to you from this study are none. </p>
                      </li>

                      <li><b>Compensation for participation</b>
                      <p>If you satisfactorily complete the study, you will receive payment or the HIT. Payments are made via Amazon’s payment system. If several HITs are available to you in this HIT group, the task description for the first HIT will specify whether there is a small bonus for completion of a certain number of hits. </p>
                      </li>

                      <li><b>Circumstances under which the Principal Investigator may withdraw you from study participation:</b>
                      <p>The only reason why the PI might ask you to withdraw from the study would be gross failure to follow the instructions provided by the experimenter.</p>
                      </li>

                      <li><b>What happens if you choose to withdraw from study participation:</b>
                      <p>You have the right to discontinue participation in the study at any time. You can withdraw by simply exiting your web browser.</p>
                      </li>
